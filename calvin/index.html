<p>
Calvin's parents will not be accepting visitors in the hospital, and
will exchange short visits for food after returning home. Please check
this space in the coming weeks for information on helping them after
bringing their baby home.

I think this is Calvin's head in profile; the diagonal white line in the
upper left of the picture is his nose.

<h3>Registry</h3>

<p>
Calvin's parents have registered at Target and Amazon. However,
comparable item to what is listed on the registry would be great.  Even
though it isn't on the registry, they do need clothing in a variety of
sizes and any other baby necessities people feel are missing. They'd
also be happy to receive any gently used items that are available.  They
are also accepting donations for his 529 college savings plan in
addition to the traditional (and also useful) baby gifts.
