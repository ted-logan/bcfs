<h1>All Flights</h1>

<p>
Being an engineer, I feel compelled to record mundane details of my life
and calculate various useful statistics on them. (See also
<a href="/yoda.cgi">gas record</a> and
<a href="http://jaeger.festing.org/changelog/880.html">gas price
infoporn</a>.) I'm not really sure how useful it is to know where I've
flown, but the complete record is below. At least, as well as I can
remember it.
