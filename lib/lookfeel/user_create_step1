<h1>Create User: Step 1</h1>

<p>
Becoming an officially-registered j&auml;gerfesting user has many advantages.
At least, that's what the marketing department told me to put here.
</p>

<p>
<b>You'll need to enter a real, live, valid e-mail address here.</b> 
Your account won't be active until you can respond with the magic cookie
that will be sent to the e-mail address you specify. So if you're a
spammer and you think you can bypass the form by entering a bogus
address, you're deluding yourself, and you might as well not waste your
time. This is not the blog you're looking for. Of course, if you're a
spammer, you probably won't bother reading this.
