# Battery Content Farming System

This is the code that runs my personal blog and photo archive,
<https://jaeger.festing.org/>. It's written entirely in Perl, which was
the fashion at the time. This version dates from 2002; it was a complete
rewrite of an earlier version. I've lightly edited the history to redact
a few things but for the most part this is a complete snapshot of its
full development history over the past 20-some years. I really don't
expect it to be useful to anyone else.

This codebase originated in cvs, and was migrated to svn, and eventually
to git.

## Dependencies

An extremely incomplete list of dependencies not part of native Perl
(this mostly covers new dependencies I'm adding, not existing ones):
